### Company Structure

Redback Operations is committed to elevating its professional standards by establishing a comprehensive
baseline for documenting information, procedures, findings, and more, in a unified and systematic
manner. This initiative marks a significant shift from when projects within Redback operated
independently. The inception of the Data Warehousing project and the formation of a dedicated
cybersecurity team have highlighted similarities in processes across different projects, leading to the
creation of a unified standard of quality. This has resulted in the production of guides on Machine
Learning, Data Scraping from the web, security guidelines, and an asset register for projects, enhancing
visibility and trackability of past endeavours.

The company's current project portfolio reflects this structured approach to documentation and process
management, adhering to recognized quality management standards. 
Redback Operations is currently spearheading five major initiatives:
 
- [**Project 1:**](/docs/onboarding/company-profile#project-1-vr-sun-cycle--smart-bike-project) VR Sun Cycle + Smart Bike Project
- [**Project 2:**](/docs/onboarding/company-profile#project-2-elderly-wearble-technology) Elderly Wearable Technology
- [**Project 3:**](/docs/onboarding/company-profile#project-3-athlete-wearable-tech-previously-sports-performance-analysis) Athlete Wearable Tech (Previously: Sports Performance Analysis)
- [**Project 4:**](/docs/onboarding/company-profile#project-4-crowd-monitoring--player-tracking-aka-project-orion) Crowd Monitoring & Player Tracking (AKA Project Orion)
- [**Cybersecurity**](/docs/onboarding/company-profile#cybersecurity-team) & [**Data Warehouse**](/docs/onboarding/company-profile#data-warehousing-team) Team

Through these diverse yet interconnected projects, Redback Operations demonstrates its commitment to
innovation, security, and excellence. By standardizing processes and emphasizing quality management,
the company not only streamlines its operations but also sets a solid foundation for future growth and
success.

### Projects

#### Project 1: VR Sun Cycle + Smart Bike Project

Product Owner: **Acting Company Director of Redback**

This project aims to revolutionize indoor exercise by merging Virtual Reality (VR) and Smart Bike
technologies, creating an immersive workout experience that transcends traditional fitness routines.
Initially conceived as two separate endeavours—SuncycleVR and the Smart Bike—these projects have
now been unified. The Smart Bike serves as an intuitive controller within the VR environment, with IoT
technology enabling real-time turning and movement based on the user's pedalling speed.

The integration of pedal rotations to control the virtual bike's speed marks a significant milestone in
achieving a seamless, realistic exercise experience. Meanwhile, the VR component is under active
development, with plans to expand beyond the existing starting zone and cityscape. Future updates aim
to introduce challenging terrains, such as hills, to leverage the Smart Bike's incline feature, adding an
extra layer of difficulty and resistance to workouts.

Leadership for this ambitious project is divided among three senior members in Trimester 1 2024, each
responsible for a distinct aspect of development:

- **Jai Wats** oversees VR interactions, task planning, and team coordination.
- **Krishn Prayag** leads IoT integration, ensuring seamless communication between the Smart Bike, VR environment, and associated mobile app.
- **Boerhu Bao** spearheads the design of VR environments and assets, crafting engaging and visually captivating virtual landscapes for users to explore.

As the project progresses, the team is focused on enriching the VR experience with interactive missions
and environments, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in virtual fitness.

#### Project 2: Elderly Wearble Technology

Product Owner: **Acting Company Director of Redback**

This project is dedicated to harnessing the potential of wearable technology to significantly enhance the
quality of life for the elderly. It skilfully employs advanced data analytics, innovative web platforms, and
sophisticated mobile app development tools to meet its goals.

At the heart of the project is the development of intuitive and user-friendly wearable devices,
meticulously crafted for the elderly. These devices are tailored to meet several crucial needs, including
comprehensive health monitoring, efficient fall detection, and the prevention of bedsores by providing
timely alerts for positional changes. A pivotal aspect of the project is its commitment to bolstering social
connectivity among the elderly, thereby enriching their overall well-being and safety. Features like fall
notifications, emergency alerts, heart rate monitoring, and activity tracking are seamlessly integrated into
these devices. This integration is done with the aim of not only improving the daily lives of the elderly
but also empowering them with the necessary tools to maintain their health and independence
proactively.

This initiative encapsulates the project's holistic approach towards leveraging state-of-the-art wearable
technology for effective injury prevention and diligent health monitoring. It is specially tailored to
address the distinct needs of the elderly, ensuring they receive the care and attention they deserve.

#### Project 3: Athlete Wearable Tech (Previously Sports Performance Analysis)

Product Owner: **Acting Company Director of Redback**

The Athlete Wearables Tech initiative, previously known as the Sports Performance Analysis project, is
dedicated to exploiting the vast potential of data derived from wearable technology in various sports.
This pioneering project aims at augmenting athletic performance through detailed data analytics and
advanced predictive modelling. By leveraging sophisticated tools such as Python and Power BI, the
initiative delves deep into the essence of sports analytics, providing customised insights to enhance
training and performance across diverse disciplines. The project has previously encompassed several key
areas:

- Cycling: Here, an in-depth analysis of metrics like heart rate, speed, and distance is conducted to
formulate bespoke training plans. These plans are meticulously tailored to meet each athlete's
unique needs, taking into account variables such as age and health.
- Cricket: The focus is on harnessing new data sources to broaden the analytical scope, with
objectives including predicting match outcomes and pinpointing standout players through
extensive statistical analysis.
- Football (Soccer): The project is advancing the analysis of both team and individual performances.
This involves an in-depth examination of team statistics and player contributions, aiming to
identify the statistical factors that distinguish the top teams and players.

Central to this project is a commitment to refining predictive models, particularly in cycling, and
expanding into running. Additionally, significant efforts are being made to develop a prototype web
application. This application is envisioned not only as a repository for analysis and insights but also as a
dynamic tool for planning and monitoring training and competition programs. It will enable athletes to
upload their data, marrying personal performance metrics with wider analytical findings.

As part of a comprehensive ecosystem dedicated to athlete data collection and analysis, this project
presents a unique opportunity for collaboration with teams working on related initiatives, significantly
extending the reach and impact of our efforts.

In the coming Trimester 1, senior member **Brendan James Kay** will step into the role of project lead,
guiding the project towards its ambitious goals.
