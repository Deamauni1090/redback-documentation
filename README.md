# redback-documentation
Docusaurus instance for the consolidation of company research and documentation

## Page creation

To create a new doc section, create a folder in the docs folder with the name of the section, this must contain a `_category_.json` file (Copy format from existing file). 

Each individual page is simply a markdown page.

## Attributions

Please attribute inputed documentation to the appropriate author(s) along with the date, formatted as:

`> **Document Creation:** DD/MM/YYYY. **Last Edited:** DD/MM/YYYY. **Author:** John Doe.`

## Pushing updates

TBD. Need to implement GitHub Actions to get around permissions.
