## Page creation

To create a new doc section, duplicate `docs/example`. This folder contains an example for the top level folder, as well as individual pages.

Each individual page is simply a markdown page.

## Attributions

Please attribute inputed documentation to the appropriate author(s) along with the date, formatted as:

`> **Document Creation:** 1 March, 2024. **Last Edited:** 21 September, 2024. **Author:** John Doe.`

## Pushing updates

TBD. Need to implement GitHub Actions to automate publishing.
